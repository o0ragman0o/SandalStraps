This file is part of the SandalStraps framework

Factories are a core but independant concept of the SandalStraps framework and 
can be used to create SandalStraps compliant 'product' contracts from embed
bytecode.

The abstract Factory contract is to be used as a SandalStraps compliant base for
product specific factories which must impliment the createNew() function.

is itself compliant with `Registrar` by inhereting `RegBase` and
compiant with `Factory` through the `createNew(bytes32 _name, address _owner)`
API.

An optional creation fee can be set and manually collected by the owner.

Release Notes
-------------
* Added public constant `uint8 decimals = 18` and `units = "ETH" for
  compatibility with `Value 0.4.2` API

/* Example implimentation of `createNew()` for a deriving factory

    function createNew(bytes32 _regName, address _owner)

        feePaid
        returns (address kAddr_)
    {

        address kAddr_ = address(new Foo(msg.sender, _regName, _owner));
        Created(msg.sender, _regName, kAddr);
    }

Example product contract with `Factory` compiant constructor and `Registrar`
compliant `regName`.

The owner will be the caller by default if the `_owner` value is `0x0`.

If the contract requires initialization that would normally be done in a
constructor, then a `init()` function can be used instead post deployment.

    contract Foo is RegBase
    {
        bytes32 constant public VERSION = "Foo v0.0.1";
        uint val;
        uint8 public __initFuse = 1;
        
        function Foo(address _creator, bytes32 _regName, address _owner)
            RegBase(_creator, _regName, _owner)
        {
            // put non-parametric constructor code here.
        }
        
        function _init(uint _val)
        {
            require(__initFuse == 1);

            // put parametric constructor code here and call _init() post 
            // deployment
            val = _val;
            delete __initFuse;
        }
